Development Process
We use GitHub Flow for our development process:

1. Create a new branch from main for your feature or fix
2. Make your changes in your branch
3. Write or update tests as needed
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Submit a pull request to the main branch

Branch Naming Convention

Feature branches: feature/your-feature-name
Bug fixes: fix/bug-description
Documentation: docs/what-you-updated
Refactoring: refactor/what-you-refactored

How to Contribute
Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
When creating a bug report, include:

A clear and descriptive title
Steps to reproduce the issue
Expected behavior
Actual behavior
Screenshots (if applicable)
Environment details (OS, browser, versions)

Suggesting Enhancements
Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

A clear and descriptive title
Detailed description of the proposed feature

Mock-ups or examples (if applicable)

Code Contributions
1. Find an Issue: Look for issues labeled good first issue or help wanted
2. Comment: Let us know you're working on it
3. Code: Implement your solution following our coding standards
4. Test: Ensure all tests pass and add new ones if needed
5. Document: Update documentation if necessary
6. Submit: Create a pull request

Coding Standards
TypeScript/JavaScript (Backend & Frontend)

Use TypeScript for all new code
Follow ESLint configuration
Use Prettier for formatting
Naming conventions:

PascalCase for components and classes
camelCase for functions and variables
UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
kebab-case for file names

Example:
// Good
export class UserService {
  private readonly MAX_RETRIES = 3;
  
  async getUserById(userId: string): Promise<User> {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// File: user-service.ts

Python (AI Engine)

Follow PEP 8
Use type hints
Document functions with docstrings
Use meaningful variable names

Example:
def calculate_roas(spend: float, revenue: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
    
    Args:
        spend: Total advertising spend
        revenue: Total revenue generated
        
    Returns:
        ROAS as a percentage
    """
    if spend == 0:
        return 0.0
    return (revenue / spend) * 100

<body>

<footer>

Testing
Backend Tests
cd backend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report

Frontend Tests
cd frontend
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report

AI Engine Tests
cd ai-engine
pytest                     # Run all tests
pytest --cov              # With coverage
pytest -v                 # Verbose output

Writing Tests

Write tests for all new features
Maintain test coverage above 80%
Use descriptive test names
Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example:
describe('CampaignService', () => {
  describe('updateCampaignStatus', () => {
    it('should update campaign status to paused', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const campaignId = 'campaign_123';
      const newStatus = 'PAUSED';
      
      // Act
      const result = await campaignService.updateCampaignStatus(
        campaignId, 
        userId, 
        newStatus
      );
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.status).toBe('PAUSED');
      expect(mockPrisma.campaign.update).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        where: { id: campaignId },
        data: { status: newStatus }
      });
    });
  });
});
